# Cluster - spin up Consul + Vault + Nomad + friends

[![Build Status](https://jenkins.liquiddemo.org/api/badges/liquidinvestigations/cluster/status.svg)](https://jenkins.liquiddemo.org/liquidinvestigations/cluster)

This script installs and configures [Consul][], [Vault][] and [Nomad][]. After
those are up, we're running [dnsmasq][] to forward Consul's DNS, [Prometheus][]
to collect Nomad stats, [Loki][] to collect logs, and [Grafana][] to display
them in a nice dashboard. It also runs a local [Docker registry][] to cache
images. It's designed to be easy to use on a fresh Linux machine, therefore
it's somewhat opinionated.

## Quick start

Have `Docker` up and running. You can use
[`get.docker.com`](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-using-the-convenience-script).

Clone this repository, then:

```bash
cp examples/cluster.ini .
./bin/docker.sh
docker exec cluster ./cluster.py supervisorctl -- tail -f start
```

Wait a minute and visit:

* <http://10.66.60.1:8500> - Consul
* <http://10.66.60.1:4646> - Nomad
* <http://10.66.60.1:8200> - Vault

If `fabio` has been enabled in `cluster.ini`, visit:

* <http://10.66.60.1:9990/grafana>

In case of panic, `docker stop cluster` will make it all go away.


## Running a specific version
To run a tagged version (e.g. `v0.7.0`) of cluster:

```shell
git checkout v0.7.0
./bin/docker.sh --image liquidinvestigations/cluster:0.7.0
```
