# Cluster - spin up a Consul + Vault + Nomad cluster
This script installs and configures [consul][], [vault][] and [nomad][]. It's
designed to be easy to use on a fresh Linux machine, therefore it's somewhat
opinionated.

It will install everything in subfolders of the repository:
* `./bin` - Consul, Vault and Nomad binaries
* `./var` - cluster state and temporary files
* `./etc` - configuration files

The script generates a [supervisord][] configuration file in
`./etc/supervisor-cluster.conf` that can be easily symlinked to e.g.
`/etc/supervisor/conf.d/cluster.conf`.

[vault]: https://www.vaultproject.io/
[nomad]: https://www.nomadproject.io/
[supervisord]: http://supervisord.org/


## Installation
This guide assumes a recent Debian/Ubuntu installation.

* Install dependencies:
    ```shell
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3 git supervisor curl
    ```

* Download Consul, Vault and Nomad and install their binaries:
    ```shell
    ./cluster.py install
    ```

* Create a configuration file called `cluster.ini`:
    ```shell
    cp examples/cluster.ini .
    vim cluster.ini
    ```

* Set up the network. You can use our example configuration in `examples/network.sh`.

* Generate configuration files for Consul, Vault and Nomad and a `supervisord`
  configuration for the daemons:
    ```shell
    ./cluster.py configure
    sudo ln -s $(pwd)/etc/supervisor-cluster.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/cluster.conf
    sudo supervisorctl update
    ```

* To control the daemons, run `sudo supervisorctl <start|stop|restart>
  cluster:`

* To run the daemons in the foreground: `./cluster.py runserver
  <consul|vault|nomad>`

### Vault
Vault requires initialization when installing. It also requires that the Vault
be unsealed after the daemon starts, including after reboot.

For production environments, use the Vault commands [initialize][] and
[unseal][].

For development, to avoid manually copy/pasting keys, you can use the
`autovault` command. On first run, it initializes the vault, stores the unseal
key and root token in `var/vault-secrets.ini` with permissions `0600`, and
unseals it. On subsequent runs, it uses the same key to unseal the vault, so
it's safe to run at boot. Be sure to restart the Nomad daemon after running
`autovault` so that Nomad picks up the new root token.

```shell
./cluster.py autovault
sudo supervisorctl restart cluster:nomad
```
